# Recursive-Sudoku-Solver
Just a short code I made for recursive algorith idea I had to solve Sudokus

My grandad loves solving sudokus so I've gave it to him so he can check the solution when he finishes one. I have to say it was harder to tech him how to use the
'.exe' file than coming up with the recursive algorithm...
